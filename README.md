## Data
The sample data in this restaurant menu application was scraped from grubhub. This data can not be edited or deleted because it's a change that will effect all the users. 

Others can not see the changes that you have made on your own restaurants and menus. But you can delete, edit and update menus and restaurants that you have added.
